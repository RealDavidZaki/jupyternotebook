    "**Project Title**: **Effects of Excessive Screen Usage on Student Attention Spans.**\n",

    "Submission by: David Zaki\n",
    "Institution: University of london Goldsmith\n",
    "\n",
    "**INTRODUCTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the last decade, the consumption of mobile phones in teens has surged, averaging 6 hours in 2013 and increasing to between an average of 6 - 9 hours in 2022  (Susic, 2022). This trend prompts the question, how much does mobile phone consumption impact academic performance. Multiple studies have been conducted on students in different stages of adolescence in order to narrow down the effects of unmoderated mobile phone consumption . These studies consistently concluded that indeed unmoderated usage of mobile phones have a direct affect on the students attention span and thus lowers their academic performance (Ellah PhD et al., 2019; Siyami PhD et al., 2023). \n",
    "\n",
    "This project's inspiration was based on personal experiences I've been through with mobile phones affecting the attention I could give my studies. It stemmed from the realisation that my screen time would often exceed over 20 hours of my day throughout the week(s). This along with my consistent unsatisfactory grade has given me an inspiration to set out and research the effects of mobile phone consumption on adolescent students.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to use this research as a gateway to better understand the implications of excessive usage of mobile phones and screen-time in general on the ability for one to focus and their ability to grasp and compute information. \n",
    "\n",
    "**AIMS AND OBJECTIVES**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will be an opportunity for me to explore the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* How much time the average teen spends on the phone.\n",
    "* The grades relative to the time spent on screen.\n",
    "* Checking for any lasting effects when it comes to long term screen time usage.\n",
    "* Grades of students who have below 3 hours of screen time a day against students who have over 6 hours.\n",
    "* To see if ethnicity has a factor at all whether big or small on how long the average student consumption may be. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project proposal my goals are: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* To see how many researches and datasets are needed to get a clear picture on the severity and accuracy of the studies. \n",
    "* To see and confirm if any of the research I chose provides data against the common hypothesis (such as screen time is good for the child etc.) \n",
    "* To web scrape all the necessary data and visualise them in order to help get a clear picture\n",
    "* Cleaning any unuseful or unnecessary data that would not add to the goal of this data exploration or is not relevant to my topic. \n",
    "* To go through data analysis and find definitive data that shows and provides a clear trend(s), which would open the path for further deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\n",
    "**DATA**\n",
    "\n",
    "CHANGE THIS ONCE YOUR DONE  number of publications and researches were picked and chosen as this number of journals would be sufficient to give indisputable and concrete data that holds substance. It should also hold enough data to help make the graphs clear and convey a direct message. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortuitously, the selected journals featured test groups encompassing diverse ethnicities, including nigeria and Iran. Consequently, this diversity within the dataset offered a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CHOICE OF PUBLICATIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "There was no particular group or person that I was deliberately on the lookout for, my sources were found using google scholar, sci-hub, and the UoL online library. As those were (to my knowledge) the best chances to get articles that most accurately provide me with the datasets required for my research topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data properly follows licence practices properly and rightfully attributing the work to their respective creator(s).My purpose here is to compile the data and provide an in-depth look at this data to draw possible conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CHOICE OF ARTICLES / JOURNALS**\n",
    "\n",
    "I specifically chose articles and journals published within the last six years to ensure that the data provided is relevant to our modern society/ standards. This time frame helps ensure that insights and conclusions drawn are current and accurate to our evolving landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind the publications I am using are as follows:  \\\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Problem-solving Skills as Correlates of Attention Span and Working Memory of Low Ability Level Students in Senior Secondary Schools” Published to asianonlinejournals.com\n",
    "* “Investigating the effect of mobile phone use on students' attention span and academic performance” Published to journals.mums.ac.ir.\n",
    "* “18+ Teen and Kids Screen Time Statistics (2023): Avg. Screen time for Teens” Published to headphonesaddict.com\n",
    "* “Social Media Impact on Attention Span” Published to proquest.com\n",
    "\n",
    "**LIMITATIONS AND CONSTRAINTS OF THE DATA**\n",
    "\n",
    "The journals picked for this research topic had a consistent one year research period between the start of the study and the end of the study / publishing the results of said study, this is the result of the researchers approach of picking students from a certain year and surveying them throughout the year to measure and gauge their performance against the time spent on screens. \n",
    "\n",
    "The time when the studies were performed vary but the results that come from it are consistent with each other, knowing this allows me to be able to use those journals without worrying that the material might not be providing accurate data or is no longer representing the data properly instead using old understandings. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, a main constraint that I came by while searching for these journals is the lack of them. There were plenty of studies related to the effects of screen time on focus / attention span, this although close to the topic I had in mind wasn't the topic I was searching for, this lead to me having to ask a dear friend of mine who is proficient at writing research papers to provide me with sources and tools required to help me find those niche topics. Which allowed me to find a bunch of studies that were related to my topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "**METHODOLOGY**\n",
    "\n",
    "I employed different methodologies while working on this project, it includes data collection, where I used multiple different sources to begin my research to find journals and articles that deployed surveys as a method to gather and collect data as that had the best results in terms of accuracy and that they generally require a large sample to conclude concrete results, The way I verified the results of the research was through cross examining it with multiple other sources that conducted similar surveys and experimentation to see if there are any inconsistencies among them. Nothing of that sort came up allowing me to continue working and using the data without worrying about them not being trusted or correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ETHICS**\n",
    "\n",
    "The articles I picked were specifically done with web scraping in mind, as to not breach the copyright terms of service clause. I was careful in my research and made sure to look back at the publishers clauses as well to ensure that all usage of their data was done properly and that the data Text extractText Extraction Methodroviding was properly cited and given their rightful credits. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text Extraction Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the topic of my choice is heavily journal related, I couldn't make use of the more common style of opening a website and pulling information from it, so I had to get creative and use PDFs and Excel sheets to help simplify the process and manage the scope a little better to make space for the other projects that had to be completed. I used libraries like (**XXXX, XXXX CHANGE THIS BEFORE SUBMISSION)**, and with these libraries I managed to pull information out of the pdfs to make the tables, clean said data, and perform other duties. period between the start of the study and the end of the study / publishing the results of said study, this is the result of the researchers approach of picking students from a certain year and surveying them throughout the year to measure and gauge their performance against the time spent on screens. \n",

    "First step I had to take was to gather and install every pdf I needed for this work, after all that was done I proceeded to name them adequetly and thus begun my work on them. My first approach was to load everything from 1 pdf and try to grab the necessary data from the tables that werent present inside the pdf. That was too difficult for multiple reasons, trying to isolate the tables with special keys and phrases wasnt working or would produce flawed results even after multiple re-examinations and trials and thus I began a second approach using Excel sheets which I thought in theory would make it easier to simply import the tables from excel to jupyter, that approach would become a massive headache over the upcoming days from tables not generating properly to running into formatting problems and the fact that I myself am not familiar with the workings of excel which lead to me having to learn mechanics and techniques in order to move things a certain direction to ensure tables were properly imported from pdf to excel. After those 2 approaches I decided for simplicity sake to manually fillout the tables with the necessary data and to clean them as fit later on.  \n",

    "The code here defines a function named \"display_table_with_title\", it takes three parameters: **title** which is a string that represents the title of the table(s), **source** which is a string that contains information about the source of the data and lastly **text_data** which is a string that contains delimited data, in this case im using CSV format. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This is what the function does in detail: it prints the title in bold using ANSI escape sequences to modify the output's formatting. this was the fastest and least troubling way to get it to work although it wasnt easy to find (this is how it works in detail: '\\x1b[1m' this sequence is an ANSI escape code that starts the bold text formatting. {title} this placeholder inserts the \"tiile\" variable into the string. '\\x1b[0m' this is also an ANSI escape code that resets the text formatting to the default settings).escape sequence\n",

    "\n",
    "According to Ellah, Achor, and Enemarie (2019), the study conducted in Benue State utilized various methods to measure memory strength and attention lapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A correlational survey design was employed within Otukpo, Ogbadibo, and Okpokwu Local Government Areas in Benue State. The study targeted a population of 2138 science students in public senior secondary schools within the specified areas. The sample consisted of 450 SSI students drawn from 24 public senior secondary schools, selected using a simple random sampling technique facilitated by a lucky dip with replacement method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Twenty-four intact classes from the secondary schools in the specified Local Government Areas were purposively selected to meet the research objectives. The research utilized the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) backward digit span task and the Attention Lapses Clicker (ALC) for data collection. The WAIS backward digit span task assessed working memory by presenting a series of numbers and letters on a computer screen. Respondents were tasked with orally recalling the numbers in ascending order and then the letters in alphabetical order. Before the formal assessment, participants underwent six short practice trials. The series' complexity increased incrementally based on correct responses within a set of three, concluding after three unsuccessful attempts at a given set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing the Attention Lapses Clicker (ALC), students reported attention lapses by pressing buttons corresponding to different lapse durations: one for lapses lasting 1 minute or less, another for lapses between 2 to 3 minutes, and a third for lapses exceeding 3 or more minutes. The recorded clicker-responses were compiled on a timeline to measure the average length of reported attention lapses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Students' Cognitive Ability Levels (SCAL) were deduced from students' SSI biology, chemistry, and physics promotion examination results. Baseline data collection involved converting raw scores into Z-scores and further converting them into T-scores to categorize students into low, average, and high ability levels. The instruments underwent face validation by three experts in Measurement and Evaluation from the Science Education Department at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Subsequently, multiple regression analysis was employed to address research questions and test null hypotheses based on the collected data."

    "With that explained I can now explain what the tables mean and insinuate. *Table 1* investigates the memory and problem-solving abilities of science students with lower coginitive abilities and how they're connected. The results indiciated a correlation of 0.049 between a students memory and their problem-solving skills. Which means that only about 0.2% of the differences in problem-solving skills among these students can be explained by their memory abilities. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "*Table 2* is connected to tabl 1 and it shows that the probability associated with the calculated value of F (= 1.071) is 0.05. Since the probability value of 0.301 is greater than 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis was not rejected. Which indicates that there isnt a relationship between measure of working memory and problem-solving skills of science students with low cognitive ability level. \r\n",

    "*Table 3* provides the regression analysis of attention span and problem-solving skills of science students of low cognitive ability level. This analysis attempts to prove that there is a correlation between student attention span and their problem solving skills with 0.052 along with a coefficient of determination of 0.003. This is revealed that 0.3% variation in problem-solving skills can be attributed to their attention span.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "*table 4* shows concludes that the probability associated with the calculated value of F (=1.218) is 0.05. And since the probability value of 0.270 is greater than 0.05 level of significance, the null hypothesis wasnt rejected. Which means that there is no relationship between measure of attention span and problem solving skills of science students with low cognitive ability level.\r\n",

    "*table 5* represents a regression analysis of problem-solving skills and the combination of working memory and attention span fo science students of low cognitive ability level. Said analysis attempts to draw a correlation between student problem-solving skills and the combination of working memory and attention span which came out to be 0.76 with a coefficient of determination of 0.0006.

    "The benefits the study provided lied within the inclusion of the measure of attention span and working memory alongside problem-solving skills of low cognitive ability level students. This approach allowed for an in-depth examination of the contribution of the different aspects of problem-solving skills to the assessment of scientific skills of low ability science students. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The results of this study support the assumption between problem-solving impairs the working memory capacity as well as hampering cognitive ability level of science students. Which can be explained as such, The greater and more stressful the problem to be solved the smaller the working memory capacity that would be used. The better the students were at tracking the information, the less of a need there would be to keep looking back and try to refresh their memory or risk losing them. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The research result also proved that there is no significant relationship between students' measure of attention span and problem-solving skills of low cognitive ability level in science. There was also no correlation between problem-solving and the combination of working memory and attention span of low ability level students. It should be noted that the findings presented here are in disagreement with the findings of Konig et al. (2005) that through hierarchical multiple regression analyses, working ememory was the most important predictor in addictino to attention and fluid intelligence.fluid intelligence."

    "This study was conducted and realized by Deborah S, C., Samuel K, D., & Stephen C, K. (2018). Based on the Social Media Impact on Attention Span\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This research paper focuses on the effects of social media on attention spans. They present 3 hypothesis and go on with tests to find out what hypothesis still stand for further testing and ellaborations.  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. The number of social media accounts has no relevance to the length of attention spans\r\n",
    "2. There is no different in attention span length amongst frequent use of episodic social media and frequent use of non-episodic social media accounts.\r\n",
    "3. There is no different in attention span length amongst users preferring mobile versions of social media versus computer versions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "From there they explain the two classifications Episodic and Non-episodic. The definition of **episodic social media** is as follows, social media that occurs at irregular intervals consisting of loosely connected information (instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and TikTok). These apps fit this category as they tend to have media's that do not relate to each other but are often stand-alone pieces of information. It is also worth noting that episodic social media has limitations on the number of characters and/or a limited time that a posts appears. **Non-episodic social media** networks refer to more long form social media types that include linkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, Youtube, and Facebook. It is defined by researchers as such, it is a social media with a blog-type interface scheduled for a fixed interval of time where they focus more on telling a story than the short bursts of information of the likes of SnapChat, Vine, Twitter and Instagram."

    "There are many different variations of social media, which include collaborative projects, blogs and microblogs, content communities and social networks, examples for these categories are as follow: Collaborative projects include wikis such as Wikipidea, fandom.wiki and WIKI as they allow users to add, remove and change text-based content. Another Example is rating of internet link media content such as Reddit.  Microblog differ from blogs in that their content is limited such as characters allowed for Twitter users. Content communities such as Youtube offer the capability of shring media among users added to their profile or for the public to view. Social Networks have more extensive personal profiles where sharing of information and media among friends take place.(Becker and Carstens, 2011). In-fact social media has become so main stream that computing as a whole has been warped by them into combining social and technological aspects. Inlcuding RSS feeds, photos, video sharing services. It is also important to note that adolescents and young adults using electronic media with the number of hours daily being as high as 11-hours for 11- 18 year olds (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "Park et al. (2012) \"surveyed 280 college students with research findings suggesting that frequency and preference of text-based communication technology use is dependent on multiple factors including social influence, media richness, and individual motivation\" (“Social Media Impact on Attention Span - ProQuest”). Further studies were done to understand the different natures of social medias and how they affect the behaviour of those who use it. It is shown that adolescents that have social media accounts start and end their day checking up on their friends through posts they made or creating a post themselves. There was a study performed by Keenan and Ali (2009) on exploring the sociability of different social media websites, where they set out to identify the user interaction behaviours on Facebook, linkedIn, MySpace and Twitter. The findings provided detail on the different effects of social media on how people interact. Facebook was more grounded with privacy and representing the real world being the main aesthetic or goal of the website.  Myspace had its attention on publicity and representing virtual world, such as promotions of online personas from film to television to music. Myspace was a gateway for media-rich profiles, where it was best suited for public promotions. They did offer a profile privacy option should that option be needed or desired by the user. LinkedIn's main purpose was to connect communities with similar profiles where the profile representation was similar to resumes, this helped amplify the goal of the website which is professional networking. Twitter (X) followed a model of SMS-length updates on a simple UI which allowed the user to gain quick and short status updates as they continued interacting with the app.\n"

    "After looking at the data presented here, it is apparent that no matter what media you are using, whether is be episodic or not, what mode you are using to watch or interact with that media, everyone is being affected the same by its presence. The study findings is important as the findings suggests the number or frequncy that mobile phones/social media are used is not related to those who have short attention spans since they do not uniquely use it more. further exploration and understanding to episodic and non-episodic social media tools are required to further help businesses and schools be more adequate at advertising and teaching or spreading information respectively. As it would be beneficial for educational institutes since they would be helping students gain access to supplemental classroom material through identificaion of the types of tools students use. \r\n",

It is a idea that keeps on expanding everyday and becoming a larger and more indepth set of processes. Also to expand on future plans further down in the project, I will completely be removing the data related to ethnicity as it does not provide a clear purpose in the numbers but just helps illustrate the diversity present in the area of which this survey was held.
